### Reflections and Comments

Today I strengthened my knowledge about html and the use of boxes. I can see more clearly now how <span> and <div> elements differ. I think seeing the demo in action cleared up a lot of questions I had when it came to designing a less linear web page. We also went over loops, which is kind of where we left off in 102, so I'm suspecting things for me will take a lot more doing, rather than listening, until I truly understand how it all works.
